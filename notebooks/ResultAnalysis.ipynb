Does the candidate phrase overlap in meaning or structure with any known MWEs? If so, which one(s)?\\n\\nThe phrase \"one of\" does not appear to be a standalone MWE but is often part of larger expressions that are considered MWEs. For example:\\n- **One of these days**: This means \"at some unspecified time in the future\" and cannot be deduced from the individual meanings of \"one,\" \"of,\" and \"these.\"\\n- **One of those things**: This expression means \"an unavoidable or unfortunate situation\" and is equally idiomatic.\\n\\nHowever, the phrase \"one of\" by itself does not have a fixed meaning when used in isolation. Its function is more grammatical than lexical, often introducing a specific member of a set or group.\\n\\n#### 2. Could this phrase be considered a new variation or extension of an existing MWE? Why?\\n\\nThe phrase \"one of\" is unlikely to be a new variation or extension of an existing MWE. While it can be part of idiomatic expressions like the ones mentioned above, it does not have a novel meaning when used on its own. It typically serves as a determiner phrase that specifies membership in a larger set.\\n\\n#### 3. If it is novel, does it demonstrate properties of an MWE such as idiomaticity or collocational fixedness?\\n\\nThe phrase \"one of\" does not exhibit the properties of an MWE:\\n- **Idiomaticity**: The meaning of \"one of\" can be derived from its individual words and is not opaque. It simply indicates that something is a part of a group.\\n- **Collocational Fixedness**: While it appears frequently, it is not fixed in collocation. It can be used with various nouns and does not form a stable, unchangeable unit.\\n\\n#### 4. How likely is it that this expression is becoming a trend in social media language? Rate this likelihood on a scale from 1-5.\\n\\n**Likelihood Rating: 1**\\n\\nThe phrase \"one of\" is a common and versatile construction in English, widely used in both formal and informal contexts. It does not possess the novelty or specific cultural relevance that would make it a trending expression on social media. Instead, its high frequency reflects its fundamental role as a grammatical structure rather than a new linguistic trend.\\n\\n#### 5. Based on the given information, would you classify this candidate as:\\n- **Novel MWE**\\n- **A variation of an existing MWE**\\n- **Not an MWE**\\n\\n**Classification: Not an MWE**\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\nThe phrase \"one of\" is a common determiner phrase that introduces membership in a set. It does not have a fixed, idiomatic meaning on its own and can be used flexibly with different nouns. Its high frequency in the corpus reflects its utility and grammatical function rather than any special status as an MWE.\\n\\n### Examples from Example Sentences\\n\\n1. **\"One of those VM\\'s is Android: a Linux OS with no GNU components.\"**\\n   - Here, \"one of\" specifies that one member of the set (VMs) has a particular characteristic (being Android). It is used grammatically and not idiomatically.\\n\\n2. **\"By then I had been promoted to Shireikan and was one of the handful remaining senior officers of the Akodo.\"**\\n   - In this context, \"one of\" indicates that the speaker was part of a specific group (senior officers). Again, it is used grammatically.\\n\\n3. **\"I ducked his punch, and got one of my arms around his head.\"**\\n   - Here, \"one of\" specifies which arm the speaker used. It functions as a way to identify a particular member of a set (the speaker\\'s arms).\\n\\nGiven these considerations, \"one of\" does not meet the criteria for an MWE and is best classified as a grammatical construction rather than a multi-word expression with fixed idiomatic meaning.', 'judgment': 'Novel MWE'}\n",

For example, \"I get your frustration,\" or \"I get homesick sometimes.\"\\n\\n**2. Variation of Existing MWEs:**\\n\\nThe candidate phrase  \"i get\"  appears to be a variation of \"I get it\" often used casually in informal online communication.  \\n\\n* **Casual Reduction**: The contraction \"i\" instead of \"I\" and the omission of \"it\" aligns with common trends in social media language where brevity and informality prevail. \\n\\n**3. Idiomaticity and Fixedness:**\\n\\nWhile not as idiomatic as \"I get it,\" \"i get\" does exhibit some fixedness due to its consistent function: conveying understanding in a simplified manner.

Classification:**\\n\\nBased on the analysis, I would classify the candidate phrase as:\\n\\n\\n**- A variation of an existing MWE**  \\n\\n\\n**Examples and Reasoning:**\\n* The core meaning aligns with \"I get it,\" even if presented more casually.\\n* Its use in informal contexts like social media suggests adaptation to modern communication trends.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile not a completely new MWE, \"i get\" exemplifies how existing expressions evolve and adapt within specific communicative environments. \\n', 'judgment': 'Novel MWE'}\n",

Overlaps with Known MWEs:**\\n\\nThe phrase \"him and\" shares structural similarity with the known MWE \"**he/she and**\".  Both structures place emphasis on the subject pronoun followed by \"and\" and introduce a subsequent clause or phrase. \\n\\n**2. Variation of Existing MWE?**\\n\\nYes, \"him and\" appears to be a more informal or casual variation of the standard \"he and,\" likely influenced by colloquial speech patterns.  The use of the object pronoun \"him\" instead of the subject pronoun \"he\" breaks grammatical convention but creates a stronger emphasis on the specific individual in certain contexts. \\n\\n**3. Novel MWE Properties:**\\n\\n* **Idiomicity:** Not necessarily idiomatic – we can still generally understand its meaning from the individual words. It\\'s more about the structured emphasis.\\n* **Collocational Fixedness:** There\\'s some collocational fixedness; \"him and\" tends to pair together in a specific way. While not as rigidly fixed as idioms, the association between these words strengthens.\\n\\n**4. Social Media Trend Likelihood (Scale 1-5):**\\n\\n**3** - The phrase feels informal and suitable for online communication.  Its use leans towards casual settings like social media comments or direct messaging. It might become more prevalent in niche communities using this style of language.\\n\\n**5. Classification:**\\n\\n\\n* **Novel MWE**: Given the structural similarity to \"he and\" and the potential for becoming a trend, I\\'d classify it as a novel multi-word expression rather than just a random phrase. Its casual nature is starting to influence how people construct sentences online, signaling its potential for wider use.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Important Note:**\\n\\nThe PMI score (-0.38) suggests there\\'s no strong semantic relationship between \"him\" and \"and.\" This points to the structural emphasis as the key characteristic of this candidate phrase rather than a strong idiomatic meaning.

      "{'n_gram': 'to go back', 'frequency': 2232, 'PMI_score': 5.09, 'sentences': ['This went on for nearly a year before I finally had enough of begging him to go back to his doctor and counselor and had to leave.', 'Got an attitude; Interrupted a newly-hired cashier trying to explain the return policy with an \"I\\'ve worked here before and I know everything\" card so I wouldn\\'t have to go back to my car and deal with crowds', 'I quit before I had to go back a third day.'], 'annotation': 'Here\\'s a breakdown of the \"to go back\" phrase analysis:\\n\\n**1. Overlapping Meaning/Structure:** \\n\\nYes,  \"to go back\" overlaps in meaning with several known MWEs:\\n\\n* **Go back on one\\'s word:** This implies breaking a promise or agreement. \\n* **Go back in time:** This refers to traveling to the past.\\n* **Go back to basics:** This means returning to fundamental principles or starting over.\\n\\n...and many others depending on context. While \"to go back\"  clearly shares core semantic elements with these phrases, it lacks their specific connotations and usage constraints.\\n\\n**2. Variation of an Existing MWE?**\\n\\nIt\\'s not a straightforward variation. \\n\\n* **Lack of Specificity:** Unlike \"go back to basics,\" which has a specific meaning, \"to go back\" is highly context-dependent. Its meaning shifts drastically depending on the surrounding words (e.g., doctor, car, third day). This makes it more akin to a general prepositional phrase than a nuanced variation.\\n\\n**3. Properties of an MWE:**\\n\\n* **Idiomicity:**  While \"to go back\" can sometimes be idiomatic (e.g., \"He couldn\\'t bring himself to go back to the theater\"), its meaning isn\\'t fixed or unpredictable like true idioms.\\n\\n* **Collocational Fixedness:** The phrase displays some collocational fixedness due to common pairings (\"go back to,\" \"have to go back\"). However, this is not as strong as in fully-fledged MWEs like \"kick the bucket\" where specific words are essential for conveying meaning and substitution is jarring.\\n\\n**4. Social Media Trend Likelihood:**\\n* **2/5:** \\n\\nThe phrase is common and easily adaptable to various social media contexts (e.g., sharing a story about going back to old hobbies). While it\\'s unlikely to become a viral slang term, its versatility allows for potential usage in online communication.\\n\\n\\n**5. Classification:**\\n* **Not an MWE:**  \\n\\nWhile \"to go back\" exhibits some characteristics of MWEs (collocation, occasional idiomaticity), it lacks the strong semantic unity, fixed meaning, and limited substitutability that define true multi-word expressions. Its primary function appears to be a general prepositional phrase whose meaning heavily relies on the surrounding context. \\n\\n\\nLet me know if you have any other phrases you\\'d like to analyze!', 'judgment': 'Novel MWE'}\n",

Overlapping Meanings or Structure:**\\n\\nYes, this phrase overlaps with the known MWE \"**keep in mind**\".  Both expressions convey the idea of remembering something important or taking something into consideration.\\n\\n* **Example:** \"Keep in mind what I said about...\" \\n\\n**2. Variation or Extension?**\\n\\n\"In mind that\" could be considered a slight variation or extension of \"keep in mind.\" It adds a prepositional phrase (\"that\") emphasizing the specific thing being remembered. This change makes it slightly more precise and nuanced.\\n\\n* **Example:** \"Keep in mind ___ [specific detail]\"\\n* **Example:** \"in mind that ___ [specific detail]\"\\n\\n\\n**3. Properties of an MWE:**\\n\\nWhile not entirely idiomatic (you can understand the individual words within the context),  \"in mind that\" exhibits signs of collocational fixedness – the words appear together consistently to convey a specific meaning.  It\\'s less common to use \"mind\" as a verb followed by \"that\" without this connotation.\\n\\n**4. Trend in Social Media Language:**\\n\\n Likelihood: **3/5** \\n\\nThe phrase appears frequently enough (1687 times) and the topic explored in your examples (\"gaming advice\") is  heavily present on social media platforms. While it\\'s not yet widespread, its potential for precision and conveying nuances could lead to it becoming more popular on these platforms.\\n\\n**5. Classification:**\\n\\n I would classify this candidate as **A variation of an existing MWE**. \\n\\n**Reasoning:**\\n\\nIt shares the core meaning and structure of \"keep in mind\" but adds a slightly more specific layer.

Overlap with Known MWEs:**\\n\\nThe phrase \"at this point\" does overlap in meaning with existing MWEs like:\\n\\n* **\"At this juncture\"**:  Both phrases signify a particular stage or moment in time.\\n* **\"At this stage\"**: Similar to the above, it implies a specific point in a process or development.\\n\\n**2. Variation of an Existing MWE:**\\n\\nWhile \"at this point I\" uses the known phrase \"at this point,\" it\\'s unusual because it directly follows with \"I.\" This adds a speaker-centric focus that isn\\'t typical in the existing MWEs. \\n\\n**3. Novel MWE Properties:**\\n\\n* **Idiomicity:** The combination \"at this point I\" doesn\\'t convey a fixed, figurative meaning like a traditional idiom. It\\'s more a functional phrase indicating a shift in perspective or argument within discourse.\\n* **Collocational Fixedness:** There\\'s some degree of collocational fixedness because the word order (\"at this point I\") is somewhat unusual.  It\\'s not common to directly follow \"at this point\" with a personal pronoun like \"I.\"\\n\\n**4. Social Media Trend Likelihood (1-5):** Given its relatively high frequency (1936) and how it focuses on the speaker\\'s position, there\\'s a moderate chance ( **3/5**) that it could be gaining traction in social media as a way to emphasize individual experience or opinion within online conversations. \\n\\n**5. Classification:** Based on the evidence: \\n* **Novel MWE:**  While it incorporates \"at this point,\" its unique continuation with \"I\" and function make it more than just a variation.
